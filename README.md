# Lending club case study
	This project is about the lending club, which gives us the basic idea about how real life business problems are solved using EDA,in this case study ,apart from applying the techniques learnt in EDA,we’ll also develop a basic understanding of risk elements in banking and financial services and also come to a conclusion of how to minimize the risk of losing money with the insights obtained using visualization plots.

## Table of Contents
Python is used in this case study.
Libraries Used: we have used Numpy, Pandas libraries for the coding and data manipulations and Matplotlib and seaborn libraries for visulalisation of the data to infer the insights.

## General Information
For a consumer finance company which specializes in lending various types of loans to urban customers.when a company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approvalbased on the applicant profile. There are two types of risks involved with the banks decision:
- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?
The two main problems are:
1.if the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company  .
2If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e he /she is likely to default , then approving the loan may lead to financial loss for the company.



- What is the dataset that is being used?
The dataset we are using is the data of past loan applicants through the time period 0f 2007 till 2011 and whether they defaulted or not, the aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default ,which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the loan amount , lending at higher interest etc.



Conclusions: 
1.The defaulters are increased when the term of repaying the loans increases.
2.The defaulters are increases when the annual incomeof the customers is less.
3.The defaulters increases when the interest rates are increased.
4.More number of defaulters are seen with 10 or more years of experience.
5.The rate of defaulters will increase when the customer source income status is not verified.
6.Customers who live in a rented house more likely to default than customers with own houses.
